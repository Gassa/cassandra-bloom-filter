This is a simpleminded extraction and Mavenization of the Bloom Filter code from Apache Cassandra (http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/).

It's released under the Apache 2.0 license.

So far I've made no changes other than Mavenizing and un-commenting the slow-but-comprehensive tests. I don't plan to make any other changes, except to hopefully keep this fork in sync with the main Cassandra codebase.
